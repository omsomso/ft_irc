- fix kick
- add password prompt for channel if protected
- change expected buffer end to /n instead of /r/n for netcat test
- add limit for aggregated buffer size
- add error msg for single buffer / aggregared buffer size
- add leave
- test every other command

- maybe add quit message sent to all channels
